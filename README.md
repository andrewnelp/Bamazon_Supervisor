# Bamazon_Supervisor
** How it works video:** https://youtu.be/zM067qBGOto

NPM packages installed:
* msql
* inquirer 

Running this application will list a set of menu options:

   * View Product Sales by Department
   
   * Create New Department

When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app displays a summarized table in terminal/bash window.

The `total_profit` column is calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`.
